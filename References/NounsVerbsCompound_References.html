                                <h4>Plural Nouns vs Singular Nouns</h4><br/><p>A singular noun names one person, place, thing, or idea, while a plural 
noun names more than one person, place, thing, or idea.
There are a few basic rules to remember when it comes to turning a singular noun 
into a plural noun.</p><h5><b><u>Regular nouns</u></b></h5><p>Most singular nouns form the plural by adding -<b> s.</b></p><p>Examples : <table>
  <tr>
    <th><i>Singular</i></th>
    <th><i>Plural</i></th>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Boat</td>
    <td>Boats</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>House</td>
    <td>Houses</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cat</td>
    <td>Cats</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p>
<p>A singular noun ending in <b>s, x, z, ch, sh</b> makes the plural by adding - <b>es.</b><p>Examples : <table><tr>
    <th><i>Singular</i></th>
    <th><i>Plural</i></th>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bus</td>
    <td>Buses</td>

    <td>Boxes</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wish</td>
    <td>Wishes</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p><p>A singular noun ending in a consonant and then <b>y</b> makes the plural by dropping the 
y and adding- <b>ies.</b></p><p>Examples : <table> <tr>
    <th><i>Singular</i></th>
    <th><i>Plural</i></th>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Penny</td>
    <td>Pennies</td>

    <td>City</td>
    <td>Cities</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p></br>
<h5><b><u>Irregular nouns</u></b></h5><p>There are some irregular noun plurals. The most common ones are listed below.</p><table> <tr>

</br><h4>Different Type Of Nouns</h4><p>1. Proper Noun</br>
2. Common Noun<br/>
3. Abstract Noun</br>
4. Concrete Noun</br>
5. Countable Noun</br>
6. Non-Countable Noun</br>
7. Collective Noun</br>
8. Compound Noun</P></br><h6><b><u>Proper Noun</b></u></h6><p>
A Proper noun is a name which refers only to a single person, place, or thing and 
there is no common name for it. In written English, a proper noun always begins 
with capital letters.</br>Examples : </br>Melbourne (It refers to only one particular city)</br>
 Jhone (refers to a particular person)</br>
 Australia (it refers to an particular country)</br></br>Example for proper noun with sentences:</br>
o <b>Alex</b> is a wonderful player.</br>
o He plays for <b>Sydney Sixers.</b></br>
o He was born in <b>England.</b></br>
o He moved to <b>Australia</b> when he was young.</br>
o He lives in <b>Sydney.</b></p></br>
<h6><b><u>Common Noun</b></u></h6><p>A Common noun is a name for something which is common for many things, 
person, or places. It encompasses a particular type of things, person, or places.
</br>Examples : </br>Country (it can refer to any country, nothing in particular)</br>
 City (it can refer to any city like Melbourne, Mumbai, Toronto, etc. but 
nothing in particular).</br></br>
So, a Common noun is a word that indicates a person, place, thing, etc. In general 
and a proper noun is a specific one of those
 </br></br>Example for common noun with sentences:</br>o Alex is a wonderful <b>player</b>.</br>
o Sydney Sixers is the <b>team</b> he plays for.</br>
o He was not born in this <b>country</b>.</br>
o Sydney is the <b>city</b> he lives in.</br>
o He is a <b>man</b> of dream.</br></br>

<h6><b><u>Abstract Noun</b></u></h6><p>An Abstract noun is a word for something that cannot be seen but is there. It has no 
physical existence. Generally, it refers to ideas, qualities, and conditions
</br>Examples : Truth, lies, happiness, sorrow, time, friendship, humor, patriotism, etc..

 </br></br>Example for abstract noun with sentences:</br>o <b>Truthfulness</b> is a <b>virtue</b> that is rare nowadays.</br>
o <b>Honesty</b> depends mostly on <b>truthfulness</b> and <b>integrity</b>.</br>
o <b>Childhood</b> is the best time to build it.</br>
o Different people may have different <b>ideas, opinions,</b> and <b>beliefs</b>.</br>
o But some <b>virtues</b> receive universal <b>acknowledgment</b>.</br></br>

<h6><b><u>Concrete Noun</b></u></h6><p>A concrete noun is the exact opposite of abstract noun. It refers to the things we see 
and have physical existence.
</br>Examples : Chair, table, bat, ball, water, money, sugar, etc.

 </br></br>Example for concrete noun with sentences:</br>o The colour of the <b>milk</b> is pure white.</br>
o An <b>apple</b> is placed on the <b>table.</b></br>
o I can see a lot of <b>books</b> in the library.</br>
o A <b>baby boy</b> is playing on the <b>couch.</b></br>
o She reads many <b>novels</b> in a week.</br></br>

<h6><b><u>Countable Noun</b></u></h6><p>The nouns that can be counted are called countable nouns. Countable nouns can take 
an article: <i>a, an, the.</i>
</br>Examples : Chair, table, bat, ball, etc. (you can say 1 chair, 2 chairs, 3 chairs – so 
chairs are countable)

 </br></br>Example for countable noun with sentences:</br>o I bought a ,<b>book</b> of neurology.</br>
o The book has 269 ,<b>pages</b> in it.</br>
o It has 39 <b>chapters</b> in it.</br>
o Each chapter covers 5 <b>topics</b>.</br>
o Alex has four <b>pencils.</b></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Non-Countable Noun</b></u></h6><p>The nouns that cannot be counted are called non-countable nouns.
Abstract nouns and proper nouns are always non-countable nouns, but common
nouns and concrete nouns can be both count and non-count nouns.
</br>Examples : Water, sugar, oil, salt, etc. (you cannot say “1 water, 2 water, 3 water” 
because water is not countable)

 </br></br>Example for non-countable noun with sentences:</br>o I need some drinking <b>water.</b></br>
o Have some <b>juice</b>, please.</br>
o Do you need some <b>gas</b> for your car?</br>
o We need a lot of money for the <b>business.</b></br>
o Do you want some <b>milk</b>?</br></br>

<h6><b><u>Collective Noun</b></u></h6><p>A collective noun is a word for a group of things, people, or animals, etc.
Collective nouns can be both plural and singular. However, Americans prefer to use 
collective nouns as singular, but both of the uses are correct in other parts of the 
world.
</br>Examples : family, team, jury, cattle, etc.
 </br></br>Example for collective noun with sentences:</br>o A <b>bunch</b> of flower is lying on the table.</br>
o He comes from a noble <b>family</b>.</br>
o She has a large <b>collection</b> of books.</br>
o My parents bought me a new <b>pair</b> of shoes.</br>
o My mom made a <b>batch</b> of cookies</br></br>


<h6><b><u>Compound Noun</b></u></h6><p>Sometimes two or three nouns appear together, or even with other parts of speech, 
and create idiomatic compound nouns. Idiomatic means that those nouns behave as 
a unit and, to a lesser or greater degree, amount to more than the sum of their parts.
</br>Examples : six-pack, five-year-old, and son-in-law, snowball, mailbox, etc
 </br></br>Example for compound noun with sentences:</br>o A barber makes a perfect <b>haircut</b> of mine.</br>
o There is a <b>car park</b> ahead of the building.</br>
o The <b>cowboy</b> was a riding a horse.</br>
o Do plants need <b>sunlight</b> to grow?</br>
o Pass me that <b>chopstick.</b></br></br>

<h2>Verbs</h2></br>
<p>A verb is a word or a combination of words that indicates action or a state of being 
or condition. A verb is the part of a sentence that tells us what the subject performs.</br></br><h5><u>Basic Forms Of Verbs</h5></u></br></P>
<p>There are <b>six basic forms</b> of verbs. These forms are as follows:</br>
o <b>Base form</b> : Children <u>play</u> in the field.</br>
o <b>Infinitive</b> : Tell them not <u>to play.</u></br>
o <b>Past tense</b> : They <u>played</u> football yesterday.</br>
o <b>Past participle</b> : I have <u>eaten</u> a burger.</br>
o <b>Present participle</b>: I saw them <u>playing</u> with him today.</br>
o <b>Gerund</b> : <u>Swimming</u> is the best exercise.</p></br></br>
<h4>Difference Type of verbs</h4><p>1. Base verb</br>

</P></br>

<h6><b><u>Base Verb</u></b></h6><p>
The base verb is the form of a verb where it has no ending (-ing, -ed, -en) added to 
it. It is also called the Root Verb since it is the very root form of a verb.</br>
Examples : </br>
o I <b>go</b> to school every day.</br>
o You <b>run</b> a mile everyday.</br>
o Do your <b>work</b>.</p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Regular Verb</u></b></h6><p>The Verbs that follow the most usual conjugations are considered Regular Verbs. 
It is regular since it abides by most if not all of the regular grammar rules there are.

</br>
Examples : </br>
o Jonny <b>eats</b> rice.</br>
o Jhone <b>called</b> me.</br>
o You really <b>walked</b> all the way back ?.</p></br></br>


<h6><b><u>IIregular Verb</u></b></h6><p>The Verbs that have irregularities in terms of following grammar rules are 
Irregular Verbs, in general.
</br>
Examples : </br>
o <b>Do</b> the dishes.</br>
o I hardly ever <b>drink</b> enough water in a day.</br>
o She <b>drove</b> all the way back?</p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Transitive Verb</u></b></h6><p>The Main Verb that takes a direct object sitting right after it would be a Transitive 
Verb. They usually construct the most straightforward of sentences.
</br>
Examples : </br>
o She <b>went</b> to the School.</br>
o Who do not <b>like</b> to lemon.
</br>
o I <b>love</b> visiting my village.</p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Intransitive Verb</u></b></h6><p>The main Verb that does not take a direct object specified right afterward and 
rather there is an indirect one mentioned somewhere along the line is called an 
Intransitive Verb. These verbs often make the corresponding sentences incomplete.

</br>
Examples : </br>
o I <b>laughed.</b></br>
o Max <b>run.</b></br>
o She <b>ate.</b></p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Weak Verb</u></b></h6><p>Verbs that end with “-d” and “-t” in their Past Indefinite and Past Participle form 
are Weak Verbs. There is a tendency to associate Weak Verbs with Regular Verbs 
but not all Weak Verbs are Regular Verbs in the English language.

</br>
Examples : </br><table> <tr>
    <th><i>Present indefinite</i></th>
    <th><i>Past participle</i></th>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spend</td>
    <td>Spent</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Walk</td>
    <td>Walked</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Book</td>
    <td>Booked</td>
    
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Learn</td>
    <td>Learnt</td>
    
  </tr>
</table></p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Strong Verb</u></b></h6><p>Strong Verbs are those in which the vowels in the verb stem changes from “i” to 
“a” to “u” in the Present Indefinite to Past Indefinite to Past Participle form of 
Verbs.


</br>
Examples : </br><table> <tr>
    <th><i>Present indefinite</i></th>
    <th><i>past indefinite</i></th>
    <th><i>Past participle</i></th>
   
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ring</td>
    <td>rang</td>
    <td>rung</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>drink</td>
    <td>drank</td>
    <td>drunk</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>sing</td>
    <td>sang</td>
    <td>sung</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>cling</td>
    <td>clang</td>
    <td>clung</td>
  </tr>
</table></p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Finite Verb</u></b></h6><p>Finite verbs are the actual verbs that are called the roots of sentences. It is a form 
of a verb that is performed by or refers to a subject and uses one of the twelve 
forms of tense and changes according to the number/person of the subject.

</br>
Examples : </br>
o Alex <b>went</b> to school.</br>
o Jhone <b>plays</b> cricket.</br>
o She is <b>playing</b> for sri lanka.</p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Non-Finite Verb</u></b></h6><p>Non-finite Verbs are not actual verbs. They do not work as verbs in the sentence 
rather they work as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, etc. Non-finite verbs do not change 
according to the number/person of the subject because these verbs, also 
called verbals, do not have any direct relation to the subject. Sometimes they 
become the subject themselves.</br>
The forms of non-finite verbs are – infinitive, gerund, and participle
</br>
Examples : </br>
o Jhone went abroad to <b>play</b> (infinitives)</br>
o <b>Playing</b> cricket is his hobby.(present participle)</br>
o I have <b>broken</b> bat.(past participle)</br>
o <b>Walking</b> is good habit.(gerund)</p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Action Verb</u></b></h6><p>Action verbs indicate what the subject of a sentence performs. Action verbs can 
make the listener/reader feel emotions, see scenes more vividly and accurately.
Action verbs can be transitive or intransitive.</br>
Transitive verbs must have a direct object. A transitive verb demands 
something/someone to be acted upon.

</br>
Examples : </br>
o I <b>painted</b> the art. (The verb ‘paint’ demands an object to be painted)</p></br></br>

<h6><b><u>Linking Verb</u></b></h6><p>A linking verb adds details about the subject of a sentence. In its simplest form, it 
connects the subject and the complement — that is, the words that follow the linking 
verb. It creates a link between them instead of showing action.
Often, what is on each side of a linking verb is equivalent; the complement redefines 
or restates the subject.
Generally, linking verbs are called ‘be’ verbs which are - am, is, are, was, were. 
However, there are some other verbs that can work as linking verbs. Those verbs 
are:
 <i>Act, feel, remain, appear, become, seem, smell, sound, grow, look, prove, stay,
taste, turn.</i>
</br>
Examples : </br>
